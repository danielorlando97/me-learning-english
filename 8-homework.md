## What do you look like?

I'm a tall and middle-age boy (young man ????), I have an average build. My hair is black and short, and it isn't straight (it is curvy). I have a beard and it's black like my hair. My eyes are black and small and my skin is tanned. I'm not happy with my appearance because I don't like be so tall and wanted being more muscled, but I don't have time to work out
