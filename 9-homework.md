## Choose some of your favorite artists and describe then in a text

One of my favorite artists is Bruno Marts. He is a singer and his music is very good. I think that he isn't very tall, his is mulatto and his hair is curvy, sometimes long, sometimes short. He is very elegant and generally he uses sunglasses so I don't know what color are his eyes. As an artist he is energetic, impulsive, creative and empathetic.

        Note:
            I don't know what does his eyes look like
                              are his eyes like
